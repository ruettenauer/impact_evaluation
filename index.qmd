# Course Description

This workshop will discuss techniques for impact evaluation using secondary data. After a description of the randomised controlled trials, the workshop will give an overview of regression discontinuity designs, instrumental variables, and difference-in-difference methods. Particular attention will be paid to the recent developments in difference-in-difference methods that account for heterogeneous effects of policies that roll-out at different times.
